  * **Small (9")**:	$7.00
  
  * **Medium (12")**:	$10.75
  
  * **Large (16")**:	$14.75
  
Toppings are extra and their price depends on the size of pizza.The cost of the toppings is as follows:

   * **Small**:	$0.50
   
   * **Medium**:	$1.00
   
   * **Large**:	$1.50
   
The user can also add extra sauce to any pizza for $0.50.

Finally, there is a sales tax of 4%.
